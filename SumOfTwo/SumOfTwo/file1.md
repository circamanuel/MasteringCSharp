This time you have to write a method that will take two arguments: a list of integers nums and an integer SumToFind. 
And it returns the number of possible UNIQUE pares made from this list where the sum equals to SumToFind


Example:

    SumOfTwo([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2], 2)
     
    It should return: 1
    Explanation: there is only one pair sum of witch is equal to 2 (1,1)



ATTENTION: The main trick of this exercise is that its time complexity should be linear. That means you should NOT have any double/triple loops inside or deep recursion.
